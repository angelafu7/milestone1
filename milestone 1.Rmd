_Paper_: "How the news media activate public expression and influence national agendas" by Gary King, Benjamin Schneer, and Ariel White.

I'm considering this paper because it explores an interesting question, whether media activity affects the way the public engages with the topics discussed in the media. In a sense, it measures the effectivity of the media in its goal of informing the public. Because the authors of this paper conducted an experiment (as opposed to a simple observational study), their results also imply a causal finding.
